# Rubric-Based Refinement

## Recommend When

- The task needs multi-dimensional quality judgment rather than optimization for a single property (chained-iteration is superior for that use case)

## Ask the User

- Which quality dimensions matter, or should the evaluator define them?
- Are there any non-negotiable constraints or categories that matter far more than the rest?
- Are there any oracles that should serve as the basis for defining the rubric?
- What baseline pass threshold (1-5) is the user comfortable with? (Default: `3/5`)
- Is the user fine with the default maximum round count? (`5`)

### Processing user feedback

- If the user states a few dimensions that matter, but doesn't fully specify the rubric:
  - <toTheUser> confirm back that the evaluator will generate the remaining rubric automatically, and that this is OK. </toTheUser>
  - <toTheEvaluator> take what the user mentioned to be the most important rubric categories. Their default pass criterion is `4/5`, or if the user was emphatic, `5/5`.</toTheEvaluator>

## Create the Right Evaluator

### Scenario 1: The user comes in with a fully-fledged rubric or, through socratic discourse, the two of you create one

In this case, the Evaluator's chief role is that of an analyst.

Include in the Evaluator's Subagent Definition (System Prompt): 
- A clear sense of identity that it is **not a rubber-stamp merchant.** 
- It is not oppressively harsh, but it doesn't give any benefit of the doubt if a provided rubric's criteria are not clearly met.

### Scenario 2: The user does not fully specify the rubric

If the user does not fully specify the rubric, the evaluator's first task will be to create/complete it.
- Assign it `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` tools alongside the standard `Read` and `Write`

Include in the Evaluator's Subagent Definition (System Prompt)
- To deeply consider:
  1) what constitutes successful task execution
  2) what "slop"-level "success" would look like
  3) to generate a rubric that rewards the former and punishes the latter
- A succinct and non-dramatic reminder that the creation of the rubric is the most important step in this entire workflow
- To output the rubric with no fewer than 3 and no more than 6 categories (unless <3 or >6 were specified via user edict) 
  - The number of categories scales with the complexity of the output being judged
  - The evaluator makes this judgment

### In Both Scenarios:

The Evaluator's feedback does not give away the criteria for reaching a higher score on the rubric directly. 

Feedback includes:
- Labeled per-dimension scores (Example: `Coherence: 2/5`)
- Explanatory guidance, written as complete sentences, providing concrete steps required to reach the next level up for each dimension
- If a revised artifact fails to increase its score in a dimension, the evaluator applies increased consideration (thinking) and verbosity to the explanatory guidance for that dimension

Feedback does NOT include:
- any explicit mention of a "rubric"

## Create the right generator

Do not mention the existence of a rubric or rubric file to the generator.

The output folder should be given a name based on the task and should not contain the word "rubric".

## Create a seed rubric for the evaluator

- Create `output/rubric-draft.md` -- a seed rubric with what the user specified and what they left unspecified, along with a complete description of what you infer to be the desired outcome and the nature of the generator's task
- The generator's task instructions live in its subagent definition entirely, it gets no equivalent file

## Generate The Workflow Topology

Three nodes, two agents:
- `evaluator-init`: uses the evaluator agent file. Runs once, standalone. Reads `output/rubric-draft.md` and creates `output/rubric.md`. No cycle membership.
- `generator`: uses the generator agent file. Depends on `evaluator-init`. Writes the primary artifact.
- `evaluator`: uses the same evaluator agent file. Depends on `generator`. Grades the artifact and writes `output/evaluation-feedback_{counter}.md` (counter increments from 1).

Create one bipartite cycle between generator and evaluator:
  - `type`: `bipartite`
  - `producer`: generator
  - `evaluator`: evaluator
  - `max_rounds`: agreed limit
  - NOTE: `max_rounds` of 5 means 5 evaluation rounds — the generator produces 6 total turns (initial + 5 revisions)
  - `exit_signal_file`: `output/evaluation-pass.flag`

`final_output` is the generator's primary artifact.


## Agent Prompt Rules

- Evaluator must go first and must create the full rubric on its first turn
- The rubric does not change
- The Evaluator tries increasingly hard to help the generator if necessary, but its feedback never states the explicit criteria for reaching the next level for a given dimension
