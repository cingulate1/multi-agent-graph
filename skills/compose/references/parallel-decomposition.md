# Parallel Decomposition

## Recommend When

- The task can be partitioned into independent assignments.
- Worker outputs do not need within-pattern reconciliation.
- The main value is throughput or coverage, not debate or consensus.

## Ask the User

- Should the decomposition be user-specified or decided by a decomposer agent?
- Is the worker count fixed or should the decomposer decide automatically?
- What should each worker produce?
- Is downstream synthesis intentionally out of scope, or should that be handled later by another pattern?

## Confirm Back

- One decomposer plus either a fixed worker set or a dynamic worker template.
- Workers are independent and unaware of each other.
- Outputs are collected, not synthesized, unless a separate downstream step is added.

## Tool Assignments

| Subagent | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Decomposer | `Read,Write` |
| Worker | `Read,Write` |

## Generate This Topology

- Create one decomposer node that analyzes the task and defines assignments.
- If worker count is fixed, create that many worker nodes depending on the decomposer.
- If worker count is automatic, use a dynamic worker template so the decomposer can materialize workers at runtime.
- Workers write only their assigned outputs; no worker should depend on peer outputs.
- The final output may be a folder of worker artifacts or a manifest of produced files rather than a synthesized document.

`final_output`: Set to `output/assignments.json` (the manifest). The individual worker outputs are referenced within it.

## Agent Prompt: Decomposer

```
## Task

{TASK_DESCRIPTION}

{CONTEXT_INSTRUCTION}

Break this task into independent assignments that can be executed in parallel. For each assignment, specify:
- A short identifier (used as the worker's name)
- The specific subtask to perform
- The exact output filename: output/{identifier}.md

## Output

Write the assignment manifest to output/assignments.json.

Format:
[
  {
    "name": "{identifier}",
    "task": "{subtask description}",
    "output": "output/{identifier}.md"
  }
]
```

## Agent Prompt: Worker

One prompt file per worker. Workers should contain only their assigned subtask.

```
## Task

{ASSIGNED_SUBTASK}

{CONTEXT_INSTRUCTION}

## Output

Write your result to {OUTPUT_PATH}.

{OUTPUT_FORMAT}
```
